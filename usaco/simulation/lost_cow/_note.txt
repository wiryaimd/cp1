point travel from x + 1, x - 2, x + 4, x - 8, x + 16 and so on

count total distance to find 'target' position at x line

eg start from x = 3
and want to find y = 6

note: x+1, x-2, dst

then, total distance is
3+1 = 4
(total range from 3 to 4 = 1)
3-2 = 1
(total range from 4 to 1 = 3)
3+4 = 7
(total range from 1 to 7 = 6)

because x > y (7 > 6), then stop
and sum all distance 1+3+6 = 10
then substract to 6, will be 10 - (7-6) == 9

the answer is 9
